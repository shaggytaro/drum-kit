# drum-kit
It is a drum kit that I have created using vanilla JavaScript wherein concepts like eventListeners, callback functions, switch statements, query selectors and keydown have been used.

This is a project that I made while I was learning and practicing JavaScript concepts. The program is pretty self-explanatory. All you need to is to press the key that is shown in the webpage and it will play a sound. 

Sorry if the images are out of position as I do not know which part of the drum produces what sound, but the main goal of this project was to practice JavaScript concepts.
